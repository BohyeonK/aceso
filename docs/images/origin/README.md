## Name

The top-level README presents this package as having been named after a Greek goddess, but there is an alternative origin story of the name. During the genesis of this package, I took public transit to and from work. One unexceptional stretch of my daily commute passed by this building:

I don't remember seeing this tag at the time, but it's entirely possible that its presence in my  subconscious directed me to choose this particular name.

On the other hand, I can't confirm with certainty that tag was there then, meaning that it's also possible&mdash;if improbable&mdash;that the tagger adopted their moniker after encountering this repository.

Of course, the common incidence of these five letters could be mere coincidence, an attractive story in its own right.

Believe what you will: Everything which is not forbidden is allowed.
